# poreQuant3D
C++ pore network analysis 
this project has started by financial support from professor Dino Di Carlo in UCLA. 
The goal was to develop a tool for analysis of porous tissue generation scaffolds. 
For background of microfluidic-based microgel production:
 Griffin and Weaver "Accelerated wound healing by injectable microporous gel scaffolds assembled from annealed building blocks", Nature Materials 14, 737
#******************************#
I developed the method based on the approach of Dong& Blunt, Physical review E, 80, 2009, 036307; with several other modifications that we
learned based on analysis of image scaffolds. 
The output of this program are pore network data that will be analyzed using tools in the poreNetwork package; which I am developing in another repository. 
#******************************#
To Run:
first compile the code using:
make all
